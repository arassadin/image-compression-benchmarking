# Image Compression Benchmarking

This project inspired by Google's paper ***Full Resolution Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks*** ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05148)) and its TensorFlow [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/compression).

# Requirements

* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) 14.04+ (tested)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) 3.4+
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.11+

# Installation

1. First, install suitable TensorFlow version. See instruction [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md).
